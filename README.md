# Project Abstract
We are analysis a dataset from Kaggle, that contains riders that competed in any category in 2024. Therefore, our analysis is limited as historical riders such as Valentino Rossi or Casey
Stoner are not present in our data since retired.

The goal of this analysis is simply to understand the history and performance of MotoGP riders but also try to understand if there is a specific dominance of make, rider or countries and finally identify champions and interesting rookies.

We are developing visual for analyzing the data and answer questions dealing with:
- Rider performance and rider trajectory, where each rider is different but we can see Marc Marquez as a regular champion but also Bagnaia and Martin as recent serious opponents
- Motorcycle analysis detailing the previous dominance of Honda and the recent leadership of Ducati
- Country analysis with a high presence of Spanish riders across class and champions and a Europe-centered distribution of riders
- Metrics analysis quantifying efficiency of Marquez but highlight relationships between number of races participated, wins and points.
- Champion Analysis highlighting where we could be champion with only 1 win but where riders mostly engage in 18 races. A focus on Marquez trajectory is provided in this sections as he is the most awarded champion over seasons.

It will be interesting to follow the battle between Marquez, Bagnaia and Martin as the last established new record while Marquez is back on top riders after injury in 2020.

# Files answering data questions
## Rider Performance and Career Trajectory.py
- How has a rider's performance evolved across different classes (Moto3, Moto2, MotoGP) over their career ?
- What is the distribution of podium finishes for each rider ?
- What is the average points scored by each rider per season in MotoGP?
- How consistent is each rider's performance over the years in terms of finishing position (placed)?

## Motorcycle Analysis.py
- Which motorcycle brand has the most wins or podium finishes in the dataset?
- What is the trend of wins for each motorcycle over the seasons?

## Country and Rider Analysis.py
- Which country produces the most successful MotoGP riders (based on wins or championships)?
- Is there a correlation between the rider's home country and their performance (podiums)?

## Specific Performance Metrics.py
- Which riders have the highest number of pole positions or fastest laps?
- What is the relationship between the number of races participated in and the points scored?

## Championship Analysis.py
